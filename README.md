# Logic in computer science

Mathematical logic has a strong influence on computer science and field of artifical intelligence called knowledge representation and reasoning. People realized that facts could be written in the computers and with a help of automated inference engines computers could draw conclusions and new knowledge based on these facts just has humans do. These systems with ability of deriving new knowledge and making decisions are called expert systems. An expert systems are basically thought to be consisting of following two components: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules, whereas the inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. One very popular idea of using an "expert system" is the idea of Semantic Web proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web in 2001. The Semantic Web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the Semantic Web would create large ontologies (knowledge bases) thus making search more effective than traditional text only searches.
